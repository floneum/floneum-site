# Structured Generation

Structured generation is a way to control what a language model can generate. While models have the ability to generate any text, structured generation lets you set specific boundaries on the output. For instance, you can restrict the model to generate only numbers between 1 and 5, or create a list of specific strings. This helps ensure that the generated content aligns with your desired constraints or requirements.
