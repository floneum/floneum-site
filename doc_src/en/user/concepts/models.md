# Language Models

Language models are powerful tools that help predict what words come next in a sentence. However, they have some limitations. They can only consider a limited number of words in the past when making predictions, which can make them shortsighted. They also struggle with planning and logical reasoning.

To overcome these limitations, language models can be enhanced with plugins. These plugins can [improve the model's memory](./embedding_db.md), allowing it to remember more information from previous words. They can also provide additional context by integrating search results into the model's predictions. By using these plugins, language models become more effective and capable of generating more accurate and meaningful text.
