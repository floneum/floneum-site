# Language Models

Large language models work as next word predicters. On there own, they can be shortsited. They can only look at a certain number of words in the past when determining the next word. They have poor planning and logic abilities.

You can augment language models with plugins. The plugins can give the model [better memory](./embedding_db.md) or provide context from search results.
