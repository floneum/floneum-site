# Embedding Database

[Embedding](./embedding.md) Databases are powerful tools that enable you to search for texts that have similar meanings to a given text. They work by representing the meaning of each text as a mathematical vector, or embedding, in a high-dimensional space. This allows the database to efficiently compare and match texts based on their semantic similarity, rather than relying solely on exact word matches. By using embedding databases, you can find related texts and discover relevant information even if the wording is different.

Combined with a model, it can be used to extend the memory of the model or allow the model to search through a larger database of information.
