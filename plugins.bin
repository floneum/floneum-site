)Add Embedding‰Adds a embedding to a database. The model used to generate the embedding and the model type used to create the database must be the same.	EmbeddingÏCreates embeddings for some text.

An embedding is a representation of something like the "meaning" of some text. You can use embeddings with embedding databases to find documents similar to anther document.Embedding DbÅCreates a database of embeddings. (A database is just a different way to store information, in this cases this stores documents in a way that makes it easy to find other documents with similar meanings)

When using this embedding database, you must use the same model to generate the embeddings you insert into this database.FormatUFormats some text by replacing any instances of {} in order with the texts passed in.Generate TextøCalls a large language model to generate text.

It is important to keep in mind that the language model is just generating text. Because the model is merely continuing the text you give it, the formatting of that text can be important.

It is commonly helpful to provide a few examples to the model before your new data so that the model can pick up on the pattern of the textGenerate Structured TextCalls a large language model to generate structured text. You can create a template for the language model to fill in. The model will fill in any segments that contain {**type**} where **type** is "", bool, or #

This node requires that the Embedding Database and the Embedding use the same model.

Returns text with documents separated with newlines.Search EngineRSearches wikipedia, fetches the top article from wikipedia, and returns it as textIf Statement.Switch between two values based on a conditionContainsfChecks if some text contains some other text. Returns true if the first text contains the second text.Write To FileHWrites some text to a file at the given path (in the /sandbox directory)Read From FileIReads some text from a file at the given path (in the /sandbox directory)
