# Image Segmentation

Image segmentation with Kalosm involves partitioning an image into segments to identify and extract meaningful information. The provided example showcases the steps to perform image segmentation using Kalosm's vision module.

## Kalosm's Image Segmentation Module

Kalosm's vision module provides functionality for image segmentation. In this example, the `SegmentAnything::builder()` method is used to create an image segmentation model.

```rust
let model = SegmentAnything::builder().build().unwrap();
```

This line initializes an image segmentation model that will be used to segment the provided image.

## Loading Image

The example uses the `image::open` function to load an image from the file system.

```rust
let image = image::open("examples/landscape.jpg").unwrap();
```

Replace the file path with the location of your image. The loaded image will be segmented to extract meaningful regions.

## Setting Goal Point for Segmentation

A goal point is specified for segmentation. In this example, the point is set at the center of the image (x: width/2, y: height/4).

```rust
let x = image.width() / 2;
let y = image.height() / 4;
```

This point serves as a reference for the segmentation model.

## Performing Segmentation

The `segment_from_points` method is called to perform segmentation. It takes an `SegmentAnythingInferenceSettings` object, which is constructed using the loaded image and the specified goal point.

```rust
let images = model
    .segment_from_points(
        SegmentAnythingInferenceSettings::new(image)
            .unwrap()
            .add_goal_point(x, y),
    )
    .unwrap();
```

This method processes the image, segments it based on the provided goal point, and returns the segmented result.

## Saving Segmented Image

The segmented images are saved to the file system.

```rust
images.save("out.png").unwrap();
```

This line saves the segmented images to the specified file ("out.png"). Developers can adjust the filename and format as needed.

## Conclusion

This example demonstrates the basic steps for performing image segmentation using Kalosm's vision module. Developers can customize this code to handle various segmentation scenarios, define different goal points, and integrate segmentation functionality into their applications. Understanding the image segmentation process with Kalosm enables developers to efficiently extract and analyze meaningful regions from images for diverse use cases.
