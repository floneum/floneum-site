# Chapter: RSS Context in Kalosm

## Introduction

Kalosm provides a powerful RSS context feature that enables users to integrate information from RSS feeds into their applications seamlessly. This chapter will guide you through the process of utilizing the RSS context in Kalosm, demonstrating its features using a practical example that involves querying information from a New York Times RSS feed.

## Setting Up the Project

Ensure that you have the required dependencies in your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
kalosm_language = "0.1"
tokio = { version = "1", features = ["full"] }
```

This example utilizes the `kalosm_language` library for language processing and `tokio` for asynchronous programming. Make sure to add these dependencies to your project.

## Initializing the RSS Context

Let's start by importing the necessary modules and initializing the New York Times (NYT) RSS feed:

```rust
use kalosm_language::*;
use std::io::Write;
```

Now, within the `main` function, create an instance of the `RssFeed` for the New York Times RSS feed:

```rust
#[tokio::main]
async fn main() {
    tracing_subscriber::fmt::init();

    let nyt =
        RssFeed::new(Url::parse("https://rss.nytimes.com/services/xml/rss/nyt/US.xml").unwrap());
```

This example uses the New York Times RSS feed as an illustration. Replace the URL with the RSS feed of your choice.

## Building Document Databases

Next, initialize the document databases for exact matching and fuzzy searching:

```rust
    let mut database = DocumentDatabase::new(
        Bert::builder().build().unwrap(),
        ChunkStrategy::Sentence {
            sentence_count: 1,
            overlap: 0,
        },
    );
    database.extend(nyt.clone()).await.unwrap();

    let mut fuzzy = FuzzySearchIndex::default();
    fuzzy.extend(nyt).await.unwrap();
```

The `DocumentDatabase` is configured with a `Bert` model for natural language processing, similar to the previous example. The `FuzzySearchIndex` is initialized for fuzzy search capabilities.

## User Interaction

The main loop of the example allows users to interact with the language model. It prompts the user for a query, performs searches in both the exact and fuzzy databases, and prints the results:

```rust
    loop {
        print!("Query: ");
        std::io::stdout().flush().unwrap();
        let mut user_question = String::new();
        std::io::stdin().read_line(&mut user_question).unwrap();

        println!(
            "vector: {:?}",
            database
                .search(&user_question, 5)
                .await
                .iter()
                .collect::<Vec<_>>()
        );
        println!(
            "fuzzy: {:?}",
            fuzzy
                .search(&user_question, 5)
                .await
                .iter()
                .collect::<Vec<_>>()
        );
    }
}
```

This loop enables continuous interaction with the Kalosm language model, showcasing the real-time querying capabilities of the RSS context. Users can input queries, and the model will provide relevant information from the New York Times RSS feed based on both exact and fuzzy matching.

## Conclusion

The RSS context in Kalosm opens up possibilities for integrating real-time information from external sources into your applications. This example demonstrates how to leverage the RSS context by querying a New York Times RSS feed. Customize the example to fit your specific use cases and explore the extensive capabilities of Kalosm in incorporating dynamic and up-to-date information into your applications.
