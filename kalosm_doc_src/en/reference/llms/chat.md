# Understanding the Chat-based Constrained Generation Example

Let's delve into the provided example code, which demonstrates a chat-based interaction using Kalosm. The primary goal is to understand how the chat system is set up and how the language model generates responses based on user input.

## Setting up the Environment

Before we explore the code, ensure that you have the required dependencies. The example uses the `kalosm` and `tokio` crates. Make sure to add these dependencies to your project's `Cargo.toml` file:

```toml
[dependencies]
kalosm = "0.1"
tokio = { version = "1", features = ["full"] }
```

## Example Code Explanation

Now, let's break down the example code step by step:

1. **Importing Dependencies:**
   ```rust
   use kalosm::{language::*, *};
   ```

   Import the necessary libraries and dependencies from the `kalosm` crate.

2. **Initializing the Chat-based Language Model:**
   ```rust
   let mut model = Llama::new_chat();
   ```

   Create a new chat-based language model using `Llama::new_chat()`.

3. **Configuring the Chat:**
   ```rust
   let mut chat = Chat::builder(&mut model)
       .with_system_prompt("The assistant will act like a pirate")
       .build();
   ```

   Create a chat instance using the builder pattern. The `with_system_prompt` method sets a system prompt that defines the behavior of the assistant. In this case, the assistant is configured to act like a pirate.

4. **Starting the Conversation Loop:**
   ```rust
   loop {
       chat.add_message(prompt_input("\n> ").unwrap())
           .await
           .unwrap()
           .to_std_out()
           .await
           .unwrap();
   }
   ```

   Enter a loop where the user can input messages. The `prompt_input("\n> ")` function is used to obtain user input, and the `add_message` method adds the user's message to the conversation. The assistant generates a response using the language model, and the resulting message is printed to the standard output using `to_std_out()`.

## Conclusion

This example sets up a chat-based interaction with a pirate-themed assistant using Kalosm. Users can input messages, and the assistant responds accordingly based on the configured system prompt. The code demonstrates a simple but effective way to engage in interactive conversations with a language model. Developers can extend and customize this example to build more sophisticated chat applications tailored to specific themes or contexts.
