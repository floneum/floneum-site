# Image Generation

Image generation with Kalosm involves creating images based on a given prompt or description. The provided example showcases the steps to perform image generation using Kalosm's vision module, particularly with the Wuerstchen model.

## Kalosm's Image Generation Module

Kalosm's vision module includes models for image generation. In this example, the `Wuerstchen::builder()` method is used to create an image generation model.

```rust
let model = Wuerstchen::builder().build().unwrap();
```

This line initializes an image generation model, specifically the Wuerstchen model, which will create images based on a given prompt.

## Setting Generation Parameters

The example sets generation parameters using `WuerstchenInferenceSettings`. The `new` method is used to provide a prompt for image generation.

```rust
let settings = WuerstchenInferenceSettings::new(
    "a cute cat with a hat in a room covered with fur with incredible detail",
)
.with_n_steps(2);
```

This line sets a prompt for generating images of a cute cat with specific details. The `with_n_steps` method is used to define the number of steps in the generation process.

## Performing Image Generation

The `run` method is called to perform image generation based on the specified settings.

```rust
let images = model.run(settings).unwrap();
```

This method processes the prompt and generates a series of images based on the given description.

## Saving Generated Images

The generated images are saved to the file system.

```rust
for (i, img) in images.iter().enumerate() {
    img.save(&format!("{}.png", i)).unwrap();
}
```

This loop iterates through the generated images, saving each image with a filename that includes its index. Developers can adjust the filename format and location as needed.

## Conclusion

This example demonstrates the basic steps for performing image generation using Kalosm's vision module, specifically with the Wuerstchen model. Developers can customize the prompt, adjust generation parameters, and integrate image generation functionality into their applications. Understanding the image generation process with Kalosm empowers developers to create diverse and customized images based on textual descriptions for various creative applications.
