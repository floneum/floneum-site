# Announcing Floneum 0.2

We are thrilled to introduce Floneum, an intuitive graph editor designed specifically for local AI workflows. Floneum empowers users to effortlessly guide large language models and build structured workflows tailored to their specific use cases.

## What is Floneum?

Floneum is a user-friendly visual editor for AI workflows. Floneum is a single executable that runs models locally, eliminating the need for complex installations. The heart of Floneum is its graph-based editor, designed to enable users without programming knowledge to build and manage their AI workflows seamlessly.

## What is new?

- Rewritten UI!

The UI has been entirely rewritten for the 0.2 release. UI is now written in [Dioxus](https://github.com/DioxusLabs/dioxus) instead of EGUI. It also uses a completely custom graph system which gives us much more flexibility in terms of UI. Some types can now take any of many type of connection. For example, a list of strings can either take a single string, another list of strings or multiple lists/elements added together.

- Package manger

When Floneum was originally released, it looked for plugins within a specific github repo which made it difficult for community made plugins to be distributed. The 0.2 release looks for any github repo with the tag `floneum` and a specific manifest generated by the CLI.

- CLI!

As part of the package manager, Floneum has a new CLI to make it easier to build and distribute plugins. You can build Floneum plugins by installing the Floneum CLI and running `floneum build`:

```sh
cargo install --git https://github.com/floneum/floneum floneum-cli
floneum build
```

- Improved web scraping support

When the MVP of Floneum was released, it only contained plugins for reading from wikipedia and getting the raw (unreadable) HTML from a website. In the 0.4 release, we added a new `Get Article` plugin that allows you to read the main article from *any* URL.

- RSS Feed

Many websites have a RSS feed that allows you to read a list of recent articles. Floneum has a new built in RSS feed plugin that lets you read those articles to text:

- Headless browser support!

Some websites requires you to interact with the page to get to content. Floneum plugins can now control a browser (or headless browser). This makes it possible for workflows built with Floneum to read much more content from web pages and even create new content on web pages:

- Nightly builds

If you want to keep up with the latest developments of Floneum, nightly builds are now created for [every release](https://github.com/floneum/floneum/actions/runs/6102318885).

- Sharing workflows on the cloud

Originally, Floneum plugins needed to be shared as a file copied from and to a specific directory. Now you can just save a workflow to the cloud, get an id, and load another user's workflow easily.

- Each plugin now has an example

Each plugin now has an example along side the documentation in the current node sidebar. You can click on the example to get a quick example of inputs and outputs for a specific node.
